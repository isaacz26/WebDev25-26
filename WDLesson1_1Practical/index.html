    <p1>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web. It employs a system of tags and elements to define the various components of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Web browsers interpret this markup to render the visual layout and content that users see and interact with online.</p1>

    <!-- Challenge 6: Create a paragraph explaining what is CSS.  At least 3 sentences. -->
    <p1>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to define the visual presentation and layout of web pages written in HTML. It controls aspects like colors, fonts, spacing, and element positioning, allowing for consistent styling across multiple pages. CSS rules are applied to HTML elements to dictate how they are displayed on various media, including screens and print.</p1>

    <p1>JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily known as the scripting language of the web, enabling interactive and dynamic content on websites. It runs within web browsers and is used to manipulate HTML and CSS, respond to user actions, and enhance the overall user experience. Beyond the web, JavaScript can also be utilized for server-side development with Node.js, mobile app development, and even desktop applications.</p1>
